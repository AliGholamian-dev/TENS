TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation)

Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a method of pain relief involving the use of a mild electrical current.

A TENS machine is a small, battery-operated device that has leads connected to sticky pads called electrodes.
White pads stuck above and below a person's knee. The pads are attached to wires connected to a small handheld TENS machine.

You attach the pads directly to your skin. When the machine is switched on, small electrical impulses are delivered to the affected area of your body, which you feel as a tingling sensation.

The electrical impulses can reduce the pain signals going to the spinal cord and brain, which may help relieve pain and relax muscles. They may also stimulate the production of endorphins, which are the body's natural painkillers.
What TENS is used for

TENS may be able to help reduce pain and muscle spasms caused by a wide range of conditions including:

    arthritis
    period pain
    pelvic pain caused by endometriosis
    knee pain
    neck pain
    sports injuries

It's also sometimes used as a method of pain relief during labour.
